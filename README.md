# Hello World Carousel ðŸŽ¡

An unapologetically simple way to say "Hello" in (almost) every programming language. Spin the wheel. Learn the basics. No fluff.

## Why So Simple?

In a world of over-engineered solutions, I wanted to build something... well, simple. This project is my answer to a question I kept asking myself: "How do I print 'Hello, World!' in Haskell again?"

Think of this project as the front door to every programming language. It doesn't show you the whole house, but it gives you the key and a friendly welcome.

The code is as straightforward as the concept. No hidden layers, no complex build steps. I wrote it with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to do exactly what you see. Like using a rock as a paperweight: it's not elegant, but hey, the papers aren't going anywhere.

## What's Inside? (The Not-So-Secret Sauce)

Each spin is carefully crafted to deliver a minimal, yet complete, experience.

- ðŸŽ¡ An Interactive Carousel: Spin the wheel of programming fortune.
- ðŸ’» Minimal, Correct Code: Just enough to get "Hello, World!" running. Nothing more.
- ðŸ’¡ Syntax & Output: See not just the how, but the what and the why (of comments).
- ðŸŽ¨ Light & Dark Themes: Because coders have preferences, even for the simple things.

## Get it Running

Want to run this masterpiece of minimalism locally? It's brutally simple.

1. Clone this repository.
2. If you have live-server installed (npm install -g live-server), just run live-server in the project directory.
3. Or just open index.html in your browser. Yes, really.

## Want to Add a Language? (Please Do!)

The heart of this project is the data.json file. Got a language I'm missing?

1. Fork this repository.
2. Find a cool new language logo in the logos folder (it's probably already there).
3. Add a new entry to data.json, following the existing structure.
4. Submit a Pull Request. I'd be happy to review it.

Typos, bug fixes, and new ideas are also welcome! Open an issue or send a PR.
